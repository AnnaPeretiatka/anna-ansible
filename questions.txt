1. Explain in your own non-ChatGPTed words what's the pros of using Ansible as opposed to an AMI template. 
When using ansible you can insert your instances in all kind of different groups using tags (one instance can be in many groups).
Once you have your desired group you can configure all of them in one click based on the yaml file.
If upgrade needed you can always adjust the yaml file an rerun it again on desired hosts. 
It uses roles, tags, variables in a very dynamic and clear way.

2. Explain in your own non-ChatGPTed words what's the cons of using Ansible as opposed to an AMI template.

need to create all the files, take care of the inventory and roles.
